## Site styling {#styling}

In this section I will be detailing the basic layout decisions regarding the pages, as well as talk about the colour scheme choises that have been made.

### Layout {#layout}

    Mention how the responsive styling is different in sv/fi compared to en - inline styling
    In the Swedish and Finnish translated navigation bars I did run into an issue regarding the number of characters in the links themselves where in both languages there were more total characters leading to the links stacking prematurely compared to the header height change. I first solved the issue by introducing inline styling in the affected pages but in the end opted to instead give them a specific class with the required styling to eliminate the need for inline styling.
